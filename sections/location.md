### Jean Sweeny Open Space Park

Atlantic Avenue, Alameda, CA 94501

We'll be at the pavilion and gazebo at the Jean Sweeny Open Space Park for the day. The ceremony will be facing the gazebo from the grass and lunch will be at the pavilion. The space is walking distance from the parking lot and is near a nice playground. There are two restrooms nearby too.

[Here's a map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1ZA5D5Z1y6qPEWDkj9keCCkz03sdEfNdm&usp=sharing).

*We reserved the Jean Sweeney Park Pavilion from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm. You should feel free to arrive as early as you want and enjoy the space!*

*We're still figuring out how the day will unfold, but we wanted to share our ideas so far.*

**Here's what we're thinking:**\
12:00 pm—Arrival 🌳\
1:30 pm—Ceremony 💍\
2:30 pm—Lunch 🥪\
7:00 pm—Departure 👋

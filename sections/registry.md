### What is the wedding hashtag?!

\# ❤️🎈💯

### What is a hashtag?!

A hashtag is a way for us to share photos with each other quickly on Instagram. Upload your photo to Instagram, add the hashtag, and post it!  Search the hashtag to see all the photos with that hashtag. # ❤️🎈💯

### Will there be a photographer?

Yes, a professional photographer will be present to take photos throughout the day. She'll be there to capture the ceremony and take group photos, including one big group photo of everyone together after the ceremony. We're also hoping she'll catch a lot of great candid photos too!

### What should I wear?

This is an outdoor picnic. There is no need for you to dress up—you should feel free to dress however you feel comfortable. In case you were curious, Leia will be wearing a dress, but not a formal wedding gown, and Tommy will likely wear chucks with a suit and no jacket. The day might be warm and the evening can get chilly. Make sure to check the weather beforehand. 😎

### Can I bring my kids or dog?

Yes! This is a family-friendly day and kids and dogs are welcome at the park. 🤸🐶

### Can I bring a date?

Everyone we have invited is someone we care about and know personally. We're hoping to keep the event small and intimate, but are open to talking with you if you'd like to bring someone that's not on your invitation. 🐙

### Is there parking at Jean Sweeny Park?

Yes, there is plenty of parking within walking distance from the pavilion. 🚗

### Will there be food or drinks?

We're still deciding on food and non-alcoholic drinks. We'll keep this updated as we know more. 🥪 🧃

### Can I bring food or drinks?

Absolutely, bring as much or as little as you'd like! We know some of you are amazing cooks, so feel free to show off your culinary skills too. And, remember, whatever you bring in, make sure you bring out. 🧑‍🍳

### Should I bring a chair?

The pavilion has 10 picnic benches where we can sit, eat, and hang out. We won't be providing chairs for the ceremony, which will be facing the gazebo. So, if you'd like to sit on something on the grass during the ceremony, please bring your own chairs or picnic blankets! 🪑

### Where is your registry?

We don't have one!  We have enough stuff and we just want you to be there to celebrate with us. 🎉

### What the wedding hashtag?!

\# ❤️🎈💯

### What's a hashtag?!

A hashtag is a way for us to share photos with each other quickly on Instagram.  Upload your photo to Instagram using your personal account.  Add the hashtag to your photo and post it.  Search the hashtag to see all the photos with that hashtag.

### Are kids invited?

Yes!  This is a family friendly event and all of your kids are invited.  Make sure to let us know if they'll be joining you.

### Are dogs invited?

Gardener Ranch is dog friendly, but requires a $250 cleaning fee for any dog that is onsite.  Make sure to let us know if they'll be joining you. 🐶

### Can I bring a date?

Everyone we've invited is someone we care about and know personally.  We're hoping to keep the event small and intimate, but are open to talking with you if you'd like to bring someone that's not on your invitation.

### What should I wear?

The theme is outdoor formal.  We would like you to dress up, whatever that means to you.  We'll be outdoor most of the time and the days will be warm and the nights will be chilly.

### Can we walk out of Gardner Ranch at night?

We don't encourage it.  The driveway is long and not lit after sundown.  We will be thinking through how to get people who are unable to drive back to their hotels at night.

### Where's your registry?

We don't have one!  We have enough things and we just want you to be there to celebrate with us.  We know we're asking a lot of you to make the trip and stay overnight and we don't need anything more than that.

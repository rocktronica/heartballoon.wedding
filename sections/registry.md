### What is the wedding hashtag?!

\# ❤️🎈💯

### What is a hashtag?!

A hashtag is a way for us to share photos with each other quickly on Instagram. Upload your photo to Instagram, add the hashtag, and post it!  Search the hashtag to see all the photos with that hashtag. # ❤️🎈💯

### What should I wear?

This is an outdoor picnic. There is no need for you to dress up—you should feel free to dress however you feel comforatable. In case you were curious, Leia will be wearing a dress, but not a formal wedding gown, and Tommy will likely wear chucks with a suit and no jacket. The day might be warm and the night can get chilly. Make sure to check the weather. 😎

### Is there parking at Jean Sweeny Park?

Yes, there is plenty of parking within walking distance from the pavilion. 🚗

### Can I bring my kids or dog?

Yes! This is a family-friendly event and kids and dogs are welcome. 🤸🐶

### Can I bring a date?

Everyone we have invited is someone we care about and know personally. We're hoping to keep the event small and intimate, but are open to talking with you if you'd like to bring someone that's not on your invitation. 🐙

### Where is your registry?

We don't have one!  We have enough stuff and we just want you to be there to celebrate with us. 🎉

### What is the wedding hashtag?!

\# ❤️🎈💯

### What is a hashtag?!

A hashtag is a way for us to share photos with each other quickly on Instagram. Upload your photo to Instagram, add the hashtag, and post it!  Search the hashtag to see all the photos with that hashtag. # ❤️🎈💯

### Will there be a photographer?

Yes, a professional photographer will be present to take photos throughout the day. She'll be there to capture the ceremony and take group photos of our families and friends, including one big group photo of everyone together after the ceremony. We're also hoping she'll catch a lot of great candid photos too!

### What should I wear?

This is an outdoor picnic. There is no need for you to dress up—you should feel free to dress however you feel comfortable. In case you were curious, Leia will be wearing a dress, but not a formal wedding gown, and Tommy will likely wear chucks with a suit and no jacket. The day might be warm and the night can get chilly. Make sure to check the weather beforehand. 😎

### Can I bring my kids or dog?

Yes! This is a family-friendly day and kids and dogs are welcome at the park. 🤸🐶

### Can I bring a date?

Everyone we have invited is someone we care about and know personally. We're hoping to keep the event small and intimate, but are open to talking with you if you'd like to bring someone that's not on your invitation. 🐙

### Is there parking at Jean Sweeny Park?

Yes, there is plenty of parking within walking distance from the pavilion. 🚗

### Will there be food or drinks?

We're still deciding on food and non-alcoholic drinks. We'll keep this updated as we know more. 🥪 🧃

### Can I bring food or drinks?

Absolutely! We know some of you are amazing cooks, so feel free to show off your culinary skills. There are also grills in the pavilion. If you choose to bring food or use the grills, make sure to clean up after. 🧑‍🍳

### Where is your registry?

We don't have one!  We have enough stuff and we just want you to be there to celebrate with us. 🎉

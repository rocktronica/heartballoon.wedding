### Am I invited to all of the events?

Everyone is invited to all of the events except the rehearsal.  Only the wedding party will be attending the rehearsal, for obvious reasons.  😉

### What is the wedding hashtag?!

\# ❤️🎈💯

### What is a hashtag?!

A hashtag is a way for us to share photos with each other quickly on Instagram.  Upload your photo to Instagram, add the hashtag, and post it!  Search the hashtag to see all the photos with that hashtag.  #cool

### Can I bring my kids?

Yes!  This is a family friendly event and kids are invited.  🤸

### Can I bring my dog?

Gardener Ranch is dog friendly, but requires a $250 cleaning fee for any dog that is onsite.  Make sure to let us know if you'd like your dog to join you. 🐶

### Can I bring a date?

Everyone we have invited is someone we care about and know personally.  We're hoping to keep the event small and intimate, but are open to talking with you if you'd like to bring someone that's not on your invitation.  🐙

### What should I wear?

The theme is outdoor formal.  We would like you to dress up, but are happy with whatever that means to you.  We'll be outdoor most of the time and the days will be warm and the nights will be chilly.  Make sure to check the weather before packing.  😎

### Is there parking at Gardener Ranch?

Yes, there is plenty of parking onsite, but only guests are supposed to leave their cars there overnight.  🚗

### Can we walk from Gardner Ranch at night?

Gardener Ranch's driveway is long and not lit after sundown and the street does not have a crosswalk or sidewalk where you would want them.  We will be thinking through how to get people who are unable to drive back to their room in the evenings.  🔦

### **Should we be worried about the coronavirus?**

As of right now, it looks like the precautions that are being taken plus the summer heat will not prevent us from celebrating with you in November.

However, we are taking the situation seriously and are keeping a close eye on recommendations from the city, state, and federal governments.  We want to celebrate with you all, but don't want to put anyone at risk.

We'll keep you updated as we know more.

### Where is your registry?

We don't have one!  We have enough stuff and we just want you to be there to celebrate with us.  We know we're asking a lot of you to make the trip and stay overnight and we don't need anything more than that.  💪

<br><br>**Travel**

The immediate family and the wedding party are invited to stay onsite with us at Gardener Ranch.  There will be more information to follow about this.

For all others, we recommend Carmel Valley Lodge, but there are a couple others that would also meet you needs.

**Carmel Valley Lodge**

Is across the street and has recently been renovated.
